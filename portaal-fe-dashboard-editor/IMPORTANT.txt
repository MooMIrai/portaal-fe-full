IMPORTANT: Path Configuration Notes
===================================

When using these configuration files in a new project:

1. The selector-agent.md file must be available as a subagent in Claude's agent system.
   It is NOT included in this custom folder because it's part of the main agents collection.

2. These files assume that Claude has access to all the subagents mentioned in settings.json.
   The agents are referenced by name, not by file path, so they must be available in Claude's
   agent system.

3. Directory structure after copying to your project:
   your-project/
   ├── CLAUDE.md                    # Project configuration
   ├── agent-selection-policy.md    # Documentation (optional)
   └── .claude/
       └── settings.json           # Claude settings

4. The actual agent files (selector-agent.md, python-pro.md, etc.) remain in Claude's
   main agent directory and are accessed by name when Claude uses the Task tool.

5. If you need to verify available agents, ask Claude: "What agents are available?"
